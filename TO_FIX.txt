wildcard (working on this currently)

./minishell then do ./minishell again and then do env.. doesnt work --> I have to create a char ** array copying the env and update each function that change this env. So that when I execute ./minishell and I don't do execve(..,..,NULL) but execve(..,..,myownenvironment) in order that it will keep all the info of the envlst. 
-> change also that it can be possible to not find the cmd in the env ... and write a error message in that case !

exit with max min LONG nbr

cd wrong directory then cd directory -> problem free and crash

when error -> it seems that it launch another instance of minishell..

echo ' " $USER " ' -> don't print the user variable
