./minishell then do env then do ./minishell again and then do env.. doesnt work

Redirection : 
	- Problems with redirection, the opened files are not closed in some instance.. like ls > tyui && cat tyui 
	(this doesnt work as the file is not closed. I created a function to close_fd to close it but it is still open in one of the children)

	
	cat <<HERE | ls

	cat <minishell.h <<HERE <missing | ls
	HERE

	cat <minishell.h <<HERE <missing <<DOC | echo oi
	HERE
	DOC


Subshell (AND, OR) --> mostly error code and error message wrong

wildcard (working on this currently)
