heredoc
./minishell then do env then do ./minishell again and then do env.. doesnt work
signals
$PWD (is correct in the tester but bash gives a bit more info than us)
Redirection : 
	Problems with redirection, the opened files are not closed in some instance.. like ls > tyui && cat tyui (this doesnt work as the file is not closed. I created a function to close_fd to close it but it 		 	is still open in one of the children)
Subshell

wildcard (working on this currently)
